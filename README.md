A program to "unstitch" [texture atlases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas). Can be used to seperate image files from games such as RPGMaker or Minecraft into seperate image files.

### But why?
I made a program exactly like this before, Texture Unstitcher, which was a good learning experience, but in terms of functionaility, performance, and code cleanliness, it sucked and I wanted to see how I can
implement the features again, but with the goals of making both the program easier to use, and the code being cleaner and commented.
